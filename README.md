# Important-Places
A small application displaying data visualisations themed on places that are important to me. 

This repository contains everything necessery to build *Important Places*, an app that displays visulisations of live or up-to-date data from places that are important to me. It will hopefully give some insight in to history and motivation, as well as demonstrate my ability as a Python developer. The application features a GUI built using tkinter and includes data from the Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, the Humber Estuary and the Planet Mars. I hope to further extend the application to include data from a fourth location.
