# Important-Places
A small application displaying data visualisations themed on places that are important to me.

This repository contains everything necessery to build *Important Places*, a desktop app that displays visulisations of live or recent data from places that are important to me. 

Purpose: To showcase my ability as a python developer, my creativity, and provide some insigt in to me as a person and what makes me tick.

Technology:
- RESTFUL api requests
- Data visualisation with Matplotlib and seaborn
- Image processing and display with ...
- GUI using tkinter

Content:
The content of the app is devided by the real world locations it represents, with one tab per location.

It will hopefully give some insight in to history and motivation, as well as demonstrate my ability as a Python developer. The application features a GUI built using tkinter and includes data from the Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, the Humber Estuary and the Planet Mars. I hope to further extend the application to include data from a fourth location.
